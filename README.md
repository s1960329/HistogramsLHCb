Development began on the 24/05/2024 with initial sample code. This code plotted several histograms from provided .root files and was used as a starting point.
After familarising myself with PyROOT I began to work with the sample code to create more histograms and experiment with PyRoot syntax. So far I have created histograms of
all suggested variables which has aided in seperating these reactions. Next, I plan to inspect variables with TBrowser and create more histograms, ensuring that I overlay some of them, and create a general system that create histgrams of any two variables
